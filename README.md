# hello-world
This is my first project to try out on GitHub, but I'm a fast learner with new technology.

Hi, my name is Shannon Denniston and here's a little bit about who I am:

I’m a strategist at heart; on a mission to drive the unquestionable devotion of customers to your brand. By critically assessing the underpinnings of your business, I look to uncover opportunities that build upon and improve internal structures, processes and customer interactions, while ensuring your customers’ experience remains at the center of your core business strategy. 

With more than ten years of experience transforming traditional customer engagements into humanized interactions, I seek to align my expertise in leadership, strategy and communications with your reach for customer success and satisfaction.
